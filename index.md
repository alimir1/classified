# Who we are
Learning ML and AI all by yourself can be frustrating. We formed this study group to help passionate people learn machine learning together. We are a study group. We **do not** offer lectures. Please see **curriculum and structure** below.

# Curriculum and structure
You will be assigned to watch videos from [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (free) at home. During class, we will be working on projects and engage in discussions.

* Week 1: Introduction to ML & Linear Regression with One Variable
* Week 2: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
* Week 3: Logistic Regression & Regularization
* Week 4: Neural Networks: Representation
* Week 5: Neural Networks: Learning
* Week 6: Applying Machine Learning
* Week 7: Support Vector Machines
* Week 8: Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction
* Week 9: Anomaly Detection & Recommender Systems
* Week 10: Large Scale Machine Learning
* Week 11: Application Example: Photo OCR

We're very strict with homework assignments and structure. Anyone that fails to complete tasks will be removed from our group.
Expect to spend around 5-8 hours a week.

# Cost
100% Free.

# Admission criteria
