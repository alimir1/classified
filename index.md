# Who we are
Learning ML and AI all by yourself can be frustrating. We formed this study group to help passionate people learn machine learning together. We are a study group - so we do not offer lectures. Instead, we assign video lectures as homeworks and work on projects during class.

# Curriculum and structure
Students will be assigned to watch videos from [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (free) at home. During class, we will be working on projects and discuss whatever we
